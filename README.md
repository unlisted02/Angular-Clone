# A simplified Jira clone built with Angular, Akita and ng-zorro


> Thanks for your continuous support. 
> Stay tuned! :muscle:

There have been a handful of cool Jira-cloned apps written in `React`/`VueJS`, which makes me wonder **Why not Angular**? And here you go.

This is not only a simplified Jira clone built with Angular, but also an example of a **modern**, **real-world** Angular codebase.


## Storybook

### What is Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

### Jira Clone Storybook

This is the collection of components that includes:

- Avatar
- Breadcrumbs
- Button
- Input
- More to come...

Thanks a bunch for stopping by and supporting me!

## Who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I have been working with Angular for about four years. This is a showcase application I've built in my spare time to experiment the new library that I wanted to try before: `Akita`, `TailwindCSS`, `ng-zorro`.

There are many Angular examples on the web but most of them are way too simple. I like to think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to **Angular developers of all skill levels** while still being _relatively_ easy to understand.

---

This piece of work is also part of me technical series [100-days-of-angular][100days] which aims at enabling everyone, after 100 days of learning Angular with me, to **self-build their application with the similar scale**. My desire is to advocate and grow the Angular developer community.

## Features and Roadmap

I set the tentative deadline for motivating myself to finish the work on time. Otherwise, It will take forever to complete :)

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/unlisted02/Angular-Clone.git`
- `cd Angular Clone`
- `npm install` to install required dependencies
- `npm start` for angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200/`
